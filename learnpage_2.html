		Super Saturated Solutions
	</h1>
	<p>
	When dissolving one substance in another, like sugar in water, only a certain amount can be dissolved and the rest will remain solid.  But what if you want the all of it to dissolve?  Since most solids are endothermic, or absorb heat to dissolve, you can dissolve more sugar in water if you heat the solution up.  If the solution cools slowly, all of the sugar will remain dissolved, making the solution supersaturated, or containing more solute than it could have under normal conditions.  When a crystal of the solute or another object is added to the solution, all of the extra substance will precipitate out of solution - it becomes a solid again very quickly.  For example, you can get rock candy by adding a string to a solution of sugar and water.
