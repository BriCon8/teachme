		Fractals
	</h1>
	<p>
	Basically, a fractal is an object or quantity that displays self-similarity. In essence, it looks the same up close as it does far away. Although the object does not need to exhibit exactly the same structure at all scales, the same general shape must appear. For example:

	What makes fractals different from ordinary geometric shapes is the fractal dimension. A plot of the quantity on a log-log graph versus scale then gives a straight line, whose slope is said to be the fractal dimension. If we take an object residing in Euclidean dimension D and reduce its linear size by 1/r in each spatial direction, its measure (length, area, or volume) would increase to N=rD times the original. 
	</p>
	<p>
	We consider N=rD, take the log of both sides, and get log(N) = D log(r). If we solve for D. D = log(N)/log(r) The point: examined this way, D need not be an integer, as it is in Euclidean geometry. It could be a fraction, as it is in fractal geometry.
	</p>
	<p>
	Why should we care? Approximate fractals found in nature display self-similarity over extended, but finite, scale ranges. For example, the connection between fractals and leaves, for instance, is currently being used to determine how much carbon is contained in trees. Not only are fractals visual candy, but also helpful in deciphering the patterns of the earth.
