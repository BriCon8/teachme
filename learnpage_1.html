		Benign Violation Theory
	</h1>
	<p>
	The Benign Violation Theory states that in order for a joke to be humorous, it must be both a violation yet benign.  This theory was created by researchers A. Peter McGraw and Caleb Warren.  In order for something to be considered humorous, three conditions must be satisfied:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Something threatens one&#8217;s sense of how the world &#8220;ought to be&#8221;</li>
		<li>The threatening situation seems benign</li>
		<li>A person sees both interpretations at the same time</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	There is more than one way a violation can seem benign.  A violation can seem benign if:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>One norm suggests something is wrong but another salient norm suggests it is acceptable</li>
		<li>One is psychologically distant from the violation or is only weakly committed to the violated norm</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
	Therefore, different people find various jokes humorous.  To some people, a certain joke may be funny, since they are psychologically distance from the violation, yet someone else may be closely connected and offended by this attempt of a joke.
